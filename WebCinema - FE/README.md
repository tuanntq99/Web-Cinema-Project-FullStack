# API
Thank you [TMDB Api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).

Link the documentation in API [https://developers.themoviedb.org/3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)

[Link the project](https://cineema.netlify.app/). Note: Uploading images may be more difficult when using the website for the first time. When using it for the second time, such problems are not observed. For this reason, I recommend using it in case of high internet speed.
